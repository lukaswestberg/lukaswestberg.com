### What is this?
This is the repository for my personal website where I am learning to use MongoDB, Express, Angular, and NodeJS, otherwise known as the MEAN stack.

There might not be very much you find interesting here but I'd like to use version control to keep track of my learning progress and because VCS is always important :)


I'll put my development plans in this readme as well.
